# Introduction to R Markdown

Throughout this course and beyond, you'll be using R Markdown to write-up your work. An R Markdown document is just a text file with the .rmd extension. R Markdown is a _markup syntax_ that you can use within R Studio to generate documents (html, pdf, Word docs) that allows you to easily embed R code and output along with additional write-up.

R Markdown files consist of the following:

1. The YAML header (required)
1. The body of your document, including: 
    + Text and section headers 
    + R Code chunks

The process of generating a document from an .rmd file using RStudio is called **knitting.** In other words, you don't simply run R code, you knit your .rmd file in R Markdown. You can do this by clicking on ![](knitbutton.png) at the top of the RStudio interface or by using the keyboard shortcut **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + k**. This process will also run any R code you have inside your .rmd file.


# The YAML header 

The YAML header is code at the top of your R Markdown file that controls the look and feel of your document. At a minimum, your R Markdown file must contain the following YAML header located in between two sets of --- :

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Your document title"
author: "SIPA U6614"
output:
  html_document: default
---
```

The title and author, and any other fields you specify (e.g. date, subtitle) will display at the top of your document.

Also make sure that the `html_document: default` line is indented at least two spaces or you'll run into an error. Each level requires another two spaces of indentation to execute properly.

Note: apparently YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language", which I think is an attempt at recursive programming "humor"... if you think humor is the appropriate word.


# Section headings & table of contents

You can add section headings to your document by using one or more hashtags at the beginning of a line of code. Adding hashtags moves the text down one heading level (e.g. `##` specified a second level heading.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Heading level 1

Blah.

## Heading level 2

Blah blah.

### Heading level 3

Blah blah blah.
```

You can also specify options in the YAML header that display a table of contents based on the section headings you use (by adding `toc: TRUE` to the YAML header). There are different options you can play around with in the YAML header to change the formatting of the table of contents.

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Your document title"
author: "SIPA U6614"
output:
  html_document: default
    toc: TRUE
    toc_depth: 3
    toc_float: TRUE
    number_sections: FALSE
---
```


# Text formatting

You can freely enter text anywhere below the YAML header, and rely on R Markdown's built in options for text formatting. Some commonly used formatting syntax:

- *Italics*: wrap text in asterisks `*like this*`
- **Bold**: wrap text in double asterisks `**like this**`
- Hyperlinks: create [hyperlinked](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) text by using the syntax `[R Markdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)`
- Bulleted lists like this one: start each item in your list with an asterisk followed by a space, indenting as appropriate:
```{r eval = FALSE}
* list item 1
* list item 2
```
Consult the [R Markdown reference guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.36341096.936527741.1595035327-1635033536.1592156702) for more formatting syntax.


# R code chunks 

## Embedded code chunks

R Markdown documents allow you to embed **chunks** of R code and output into your document, so the reader can see your results and how they were generated. Here is the basic syntax for a code chunk.

<pre class="output_example">```{r} 
# do something
(100 * 2) / 10 
```</pre>

Without any options specified, your document will show the code from inside the code chunk followed by any corresponding output.
```{r}
# do something
(100 * 2) / 10 
```

The handy keyboard shortcut to insert a code chunk is **Ctrl+Alt+I** or	**Cmd+Option+I** for Windows and Macs, respectively.

There are a number of options you can use to specify the handling of each code chunk. Here is a code check with `echo = FALSE` so the code chunk will run but only the output will show up in your knitted documented.

<pre class="output_example">```{r echo = FALSE} 
# nevermind
```</pre>

`include = FALSE` is another common code chunk option that executes the code chunk but suppresses both the code and output. 


## Document wide code chunk options

You can also specify code chunk options that apply to the entire document. It's often a good idea to use the following document-wide code chunk to hide warnings and messages that might show up in the console after running R code, but don't belong in your document. 

<pre class="output_example">```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```</pre>

## In-line code chunks

Code results can be inserted directly into the text of a .Rmd file by enclosing the code with `r` (backticks). You can use this syntax to refer to objects in R.

It's particularly useful syntax for referring to stored calculations, rather than hard-coding the values in your write-up. Let's suppose we want to make a calculation based on the Gapminder data frame (after loading the Gapminder library).

```{r warning = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
gm_india <- subset(gapminder, country == "India")
mean(gm_india$lifeExp)
```
You could reference this calculation explicitly in your text write-up.

<pre class = "output_example">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was 53.17.
</pre>

A better way to do this is to point to the object in R that contains the mean using an in-line code reference to the mean.

<pre class = "output_example">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was `r knitr::inline_expr('mean(gm_india$lifeExp)')`.
</pre>

This approach will generate the following output in your knitted document.

<pre class = "output_out">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was `r mean(gm_india$lifeExp)`.
</pre>

Even better, let's use the `round()` function to improve the display format.

<pre class = "output_example">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was `r knitr::inline_expr('round(mean(gm_india$lifeExp), 1)')`.
</pre>

<pre class = "output_out">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was `r round(mean(gm_india$lifeExp),1)`.
</pre>


# Workflow, tips and troubleshooting


## Workflow

1. Set up a clear file structure and stick to it. For example, create a Class folder, and then an Assignments folder within Class, and an Assignment 1 folder within Assignment (U6614/Assignments/Assignment 1). 

2. Open a new R Markdown file. Specify the settings you want in the YAML header

3. Save the R Markdown file in the appropriate folder. Make sure any other files you point to (e.g. data, images) are also stored in the same folder.


## Tips and troubleshooting

* For the purposes of this class, all submissions should be submitted as html documents "knit" from an R Markdown file. Knitting pdf files requires Latex, which is pretty straightforward once you get things up and running, but we don't have the capacity to troubleshoot software setup issues that can arise. html files are also easier to share with others to run because they don't require the appropriate Latex setup.

* Treat R Markdown as its own system separate from the R console. If you refer to an object in a code chunk you first need to create it in R Markdown, an object created in the R Console won't be recognized by your R Markdown document.

* Remember you only have to `install.packages()` once but you do have to load a package before using it with the `library()` function. You should never include `install.packages()` in your R Markdown script, but you should always load the libraries you need at the beginning of your script. Failing to load the correct libraries is a common source of errors.

* Make sure any files you use are located in your working directory, which should be the same folder as your .rmd file.

* Try knitting early and often. Don't wait until the end, or you're likely to have numerous errors to sort through. Knitting/running code piecewise as you go is a good way to identify errors and coding mistakes before things get too complicated.

* Use section headers and comments to structure your write-up according to assignment questions or other document structure you want to create.
